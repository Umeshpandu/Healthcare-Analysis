🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover meaningful insights about patients, medical conditions, and risk factors. It uses Python for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. The aim is to support better decision-making in healthcare by identifying trends and predicting health risks.

⚙️ Technologies & Tools
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
-Import healthcare dataset
-Handle missing values and data types
-Remove duplicates and outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Summary statistics and distributions
-Correlation analysis
-Visualizations: histograms, bar plots, heatmaps

3. Feature Engineering
-Encoding categorical features
-Normalization / scaling
-Creating derived features for better model performance

4. Predictive Modeling
-Train/test split
-Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or other ML models
-Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

5. Results & Insights
-Key patterns in patient health conditions
-Identification of major risk factors
-Predictive capability for early disease detection

📊 Key Visualizations
